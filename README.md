This application offers a platform where users who cannot afford therapy can receive free psychological support. It offers the opportunity to consult with licensed professionals and aims to provide users with support in difficult times. It aims to meet the psychological support needs of users by prioritizing user privacy and security.

Seeking psychological support can be a challenging process in developing and developed countries. Accessing these supports can be even more difficult, especially for us, the students. State-provided appointments are available to a minority of the population, and psychological support from private institutions is unaffordable for low- and middle-income families. Therefore, new solutions are needed to meet this need financially and increase its accessibility. We, as a team (choosing the student community as a pilot for now), believed that bringing together people who cannot afford therapy expenses and therapists who can devote a few sessions a month to this social responsibility project could solve these problems, and we set out.

In choosing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for our solution, we focused on Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, specifically target 3.8, which aims to "achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all."

Additionally, we selected Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, with a focus on target 10.2, which seeks to "empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or another status."

These goals and targets align with our mission to provide accessible psychological support to students regardless of their socioeconomic status, thereby promoting mental well-being and reducing inequalities in access to healthcare services. By addressing these SDGs, we aim to contribute to broader global efforts towards achieving a more equitable and healthy society.

Our initiative tackles the prevalent issue of limited access to psychological support for students, particularly those from low- and middle-income backgrounds, by providing a platform that connects them with volunteer therapists. As a result, students often find it challenging to access the mental health resources necessary to navigate various challenges they encounter during their academic journey.

Through our platform, students can access therapy sessions at no cost, facilitated by therapists who generously volunteer their time. This not only addresses the financial barrier but also ensures that students receive the support they need, irrespective of their economic status. Moreover, it empowers therapists to contribute to social responsibility projects and make a tangible impact on the mental well-being of their communities.

Our data analytics tools enable us to analyze trends, identify areas for improvement, and measure the overall reach and impact of our platform. By leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs), such as session attendance rates and user satisfaction scores, we can assess our progress towards our goals and make data-driven decisions to optimize our platform for maximum effectiveness. Through our continuous monitoring and evaluation efforts, we strive to ensure that our solution remains responsive to the evolving needs of students and therapists alike.
